# Frontend-Block-Renderer

Block Renderer is a Web Minecraft block... renderer (yeah, really).  
The ultimate goal is to be able to display all Minecraft models, export them to image, import his own resource pack...
Resources (models, textures, etc) are provided by a [REST API backend](https://github.com/theogiraudet/Backend-Block-Renderer).
